Worldwide Animal Rabies Cases
This was a project for my final module in CareerFoundry's Data Analysis course.  I analyzed worldwide animal rabies cases based on data found on the World Organization for Animal Health's website.  Although the module focused on correlation, linear regression, and Kmeans clustering analysis the data didn't lend itself to this type of analysis.  Timelines, geography, and categorical analysis provided more information.  Jupyter Notebook was used for all analyses.
